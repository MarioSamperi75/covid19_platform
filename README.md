COVIDCARTA

CovidKarta aims to keep people updated in a simple and effective way in the belief that statistics are often unattractive and difficult to read, no matter how relevant and current they are. 
In order to achieve this goal, we use a map of Sweden whose regions change colour depending on the level of infection and respond interactively with details of the infection situation. 
The result of the project is twofold. From a technical point of view, we have learned to show how it is possible to use SVG images in a React web application and also to take advantage of its specific characteristics and interaction possibilities. At the same time, we have created a working platform which can quickly reach a large number of people, due to its immediacy.
This interesting exercise in data analysis gave us the opportunity to examine one of the most requested JavaScript libraries, Reactjs. The social significance of the project is quite evident: conscious and informed people can better adapt their social behaviour to a crisis situation and thus better contribute to reducing the infection of the virus in the country.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
